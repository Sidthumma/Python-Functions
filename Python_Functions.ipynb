        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python\n",
        "-> A function is a block of reusable code defined using def, while a method is a function that belongs to an object (class instance) and is called using object.method(). Methods often operate on the object’s data, while functions are more general-purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python\n",
        "-> Parameters are the variables listed in a function’s definition, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when calling it. In def greet(name):, name is a parameter, and in greet(\"Alice\"), \"Alice\" is an argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python\n",
        "-> Functions can be defined using def, lambda, or built-in functions. They can be called by passing arguments directly, using keyword arguments, or unpacking lists/tuples (*args) and dictionaries (**kwargs).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function\n",
        "-> The return statement sends back a value from a function to the caller. If return is omitted, the function returns None by default. It allows functions to produce reusable results instead of just printing output.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables\n",
        "-> An iterable is an object that can be looped over (like lists, tuples, or strings), while an iterator is an object with __iter__() and __next__() methods that produce values one at a time. Iterators do not store all values in memory, making them more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined\n",
        "-> Generators are a special type of iterator created using the yield keyword inside a function. They generate values lazily, meaning they produce one value at a time instead of storing all results in memory, which improves performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions\n",
        "-> They save memory by yielding values one by one instead of storing them all at once. They also improve performance for large datasets and allow for cleaner, more readable code compared to manual iterator implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used\n",
        "-> A lambda function is an anonymous, single-expression function written as lambda x: x * 2. It’s used for short, throwaway functions, often in functional programming with map(), filter(), and sorted().\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python\n",
        "-> The map() function applies a given function to all items in an iterable and returns a map object (iterator). For example, map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]) returns [2, 4, 6] (after converting to a list).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python\n",
        "-> map() applies a function to each item and returns transformed values.\n",
        "filter() selects items that satisfy a condition.\n",
        "reduce() (from functools) reduces a sequence to a single value using an accumulator function.\n",
